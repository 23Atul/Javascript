- compiler = converts high(human readable) level lang into low (machine) readable lang
- runtime = runs the compiled code to give an output or an error
- strictly = they check the datatype and  throw error in compiler itself
- loosely = they check the datatypes in runtime rather than compiler


- variables => var name = datatypes

- undefined or null => implicitly whereas , null is defined by developers for empty values

- functions

function name(a){
  return a*2
}

console.log(name(a))

- concatination and type coercion

- type coercion happens on compiler or runtime => runtime

- a datatype is converted into another or a datatype is treated as another

- unary => +"string"  => converts string into number

- mathematical and comparison operators

- conditional statement (if else if else)
